    <h2> Description </h2>

<p>Hello all ! I'd like to share with you a delicious recipe that I learned from my mother and kept improving since I started living alone. It is a curry coconut chicken with rice. A dish that is very special for me and that I don't quite make often enough.</p>
<p>For this dish, you will need a few ingredients, I shop mine from the vietnamese store close to my place but you should be able to find the relevant ingredients anywhere. I do recommend vietnamese and chinese shops though, they have some quality products for this kind of preparation.</p>    

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p> For 6 servings</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white onion, diced finely</li>
    <li>1 red chile pepper, diced, (can sub 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes for this or a jalapeno)</li>
    <li>1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast, diced into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander</li>
    <li>1 cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth, (I like to use Better than Buillion paste with water)</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can coconut milk , (I like Thai kitchen)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped basil leaves, (or 2 teaspoons dried basil)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and peppers and sautee for a couple of minutes. Add the chicken and sautee for 5-6 minutes or until no longer pink. Add more oil if needed while cooking.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, Add the curry powder, coriander, and rice. Sautee for 30 seconds. This helps the spices bloom. Quickly add the chicken broth, coconut milk, and salt.</li>
    <li>Simmer covered over low heat for 15-20 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in the ginger for the last couple minutes. </li>
    <li>When rice is tender, stir in basil and serve.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and sautee for the last minute of cooking. Push mixture to the side of  the pan.</li>

</ol>
